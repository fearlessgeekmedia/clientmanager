# Fearless Geek Media Client Management Sytem

This is just a simple bash script that I've written with the assistance of AI to manage clients. I'm still working on things with it, but it's a fun little side project.

# Dependencies
fzf

# Instructions

You can put the script in a directory that's in your `$PATH`. I prefer `~/.local/bin`. 

You will want to copy services.txt to your `$HOME` folder.
